# OpenTreeMap 2 Map Tile Server

This project requires a `settings.json` file in the root directory, containing connection information.

It should be similar to:
```
{
    "username": "user",
    "host": "1.2.3.4",
    "password": "users_password",
    "port": "123",
    "redishost": "2.3.4.5"
}
```

Please view the [javascript documentation](https://rawgithub.com/OpenTreeMap/OTM2-tiler/master/docs/filterObjectToWhere.html).
